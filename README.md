# Resume Portfolio
# The Purpose of the Portfolio

This Portfolio has been updated to include contact information, such as email or phone number. The portfolio is a resume that includes a link to my Github repository and LinkedIn profile. It is clean and legible and has good color choices, and font sizes, along with a polished user interface that is mobile responsive. At the bottom of the Portfolio resume you will find a link to a paper copy of my resume.  

The Github profile has been updated with a biography and a profile picture. You will be able to email me if you want to get in touch with me, as well as view pinned repositories that are complete and well done. My portfolio has been pinned so that it can be found easily by prospective employers. You will also be able to see that I have found a few people who I am following so that I can collaborate and keep up with the work they are currently working on. For each project in the repository, you will be able to find a Readme file that contains information so that the person viewing it will know what they are looking at. 

The resume includes a heading with my name, phone number, professional email address, links to LinkedIn, my current portfolio and GitHub. Towards the bottom of the resume, you will find a skills section with programming languages I have used, as well as projects I have worked on. There will be a brief description of the projects with the languages that were used on each. If you want to review them, you are provided a link that will take you to the project or website listed.
